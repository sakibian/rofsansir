Rofsan Sir: Brand Identity & Development Strategy

Focus: O/A Level Bengali Education | Cambridge Assessment Specialist

1. Brand Overview

Brand Essence: Academic Excellence, Trust, and Bengali Heritage.

2. Visual Identity (Brand Guidelines)

Color Palette

Based on the existing logo and the "Cambridge" association, we use a "Academic Elite" palette:

Primary Navy (#003366): Represents authority, the Cambridge connection, and trust.

Secondary Crimson/Deep Red (#A30000): Used for CTA buttons (Enrol Now) and to highlight "Examiner Tips."

Gold/Amber (#FFD700): For achievement icons, stars, and "A*" badges.

Clean White/Light Grey (#F9F9F9): Backgrounds to ensure readability of Bengali script.

Typography

Primary Headline (Bengali): Hind Siliguri or Kalpurush (Bold, clean, and legible).

Primary Headline (English): Amaranth (as used in the logo) or Montserrat.

Body Text: Open Sans or Roboto for high digital readability across devices.

Imagery Style

Portraiture: Professional, warm photos of Rofsan Sir in an academic setting (as seen in the "Pic.jpg" file).

Graphic Elements: Use "A*" badges, Cambridge-style seals, and high-quality mockups of his published books.
